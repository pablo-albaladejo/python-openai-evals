## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Rate Limits**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **❌ Rate Limit Exceeded**

```
Error code: 429 - rate_limit_exceeded
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase delay** between requests:
   ```python
   REQUEST_DELAY = 1.0  # Increase from 0.5 to 1.0 seconds
   ```
2. **Use cheaper model**:
   ```python
   GENERATION_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
   JUDGE_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
   ```
3. **Upgrade OpenAI plan** for higher limits

#### **❌ Quota Exceeded**

```
Error code: 429 - insufficient_quota
```

**Solution:** Upgrade your OpenAI plan at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

#### **🔄 Automatic Handling**

The system includes:

- **Exponential backoff**: Waits longer between retry attempts
- **Smart delays**: Respects OpenAI's suggested wait times
- **Max retries**: Up to 5 attempts before giving up
- **Error recovery**: Continues with other prompts if one fails

#### **⚙️ Configuration Options**

```python
# In movie_evaluator_with_evals.py
REQUEST_DELAY = 0.5    # Seconds between requests (increase if needed)
MAX_RETRIES = 5        # Maximum retry attempts
GENERATION_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Cheaper = fewer limits
JUDGE_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"       # Same as above
```

### **💡 Prevention Tips:**

- Start with `python movie_evaluator.py` (heuristic evaluation, no API calls)
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for testing before upgrading to GPT-4o-mini
- Add longer delays if you have many prompts/test cases
- Monitor your usage at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
